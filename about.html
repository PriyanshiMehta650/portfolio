                            Hello everyone, I am Priyanshi Mehta. As a dedicated and forward-thinking MCA student,
                            I bring a passion for computer science coupled with a diverse skill set that spans various
                            facets of technology.
                            
                            Some of my hobbies include writing poetry, dancing, and singing. I'm also passionate about
                            participating in co-curricular activitie My strengths lie in being hardworking, dedicated,
                            detail-oriented, and compassionate
                            
                            I hail from Barkakana, Jharkhand, often referred to as 'The Land of Forests.' This region is
                            known for its rich cultural diversity with various tribal communities contributing to its heritage.
                            Regarding my academic journey, I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Application from Nirmala College
                            in Ranchi. Currently, I'm pursuing my Master's in Computer Applications (MCA) from Lovely Professional
                            University in Punjab.Throughout my academic journey, I actively engaged in both
                            academic and co-curricular activities.
                            
                            In terms of achievements, I take pride in maintaining a 100% attendance record throughout my academic journey,
                            demonstrating my commitment to learning and punctuality. I also secured the 3rd position in the 'Ek Bharat Shreshtha
                            Bharat' poster making competition, where I had the opportunity to showcase my creativity and artistic skills.
                            Additionally, I gained valuable hands-on experience through internships, including one in graphic designing and
                            another with an NGO focusing on teaching and education initiatives. Looking ahead, my life's objective is to give my best,
                            inspire others, and earn the appreciation of those around me. Ultimately, I aim to make my parents proud and contribute positively to society
